What if home for you?

Werever it is, you have to keep it at least somewhat clean!
But dirty won't stop comming.

In this "join equal things so they vanish" variant,
you have to actually _swipe_ things up with a broom.
Hold space to use your broom, arrow keys to just
move around. When like-dirty is together, it will
go away!

# Installing

it is instalable in any system where Python 3.7 runs - just
make sure you have "pip" working for your Python.

Just type `pip install homekeeper-game` - it should download the latest
version along the required libraries. Then, just type `python -m homekeeper` to play.


The source code and future development of the game are at
https://github.com/jsbueno/homekeeper


To install Python 3.7: https://python.org
To install Python's pip for Windows: https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/
(Or preferably, create a virtualenv with python -m venv)

To install pygame and numpy: "pip install pygame numpy"

# Playing the Game

The game itself has "Atarish" style graphics, and consists in random
patches of dirty poping up in a run. You have to swype all then - putting
patches from the same color together - once you have at least 4 patches of
dirty of the same color clumped together, they will vanish.

To swype, move the broom up to behind the patch you want to move using
the arrow keys, then press and hold the space bar while using the
arrow keys to swype the dirty. You can move up to two patches of dirty
in a row (but not three).

Also, you will findout that certain types of dust can't be stepped on,
others need more than 4 clumps to vanish.

And rememember: if you manage to group more than 4 patches at once,
you will be rewarded with extra points.
